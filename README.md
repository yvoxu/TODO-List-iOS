# TODO-List-iOS

This is a ToDo List iOS app written in Swift. I used Realm to store data. 

## Functionalities: 
### Add a to do list(category)/item

### Delete a to do list/item
![delete](https://github.com/yvoxu/TODO-List-iOS/blob/master/demo/delete.png)

### Search for a to do list item and the search result is ordered by the time it was created
